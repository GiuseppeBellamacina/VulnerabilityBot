# Vulnerability Bot
Local Client/Server system which uses a vulnerability database to answer the user's questions about vulnerabilities.

Made in collaboration with [Drake9098](https://github.com/Drake9098)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
   
**Attention: There isn't a requirements.txt file, so you have to install the requirements manually.**
 
Essentially, you need to install the following packages:
- quart
- httpx
- uvicorn
- streamlit
- pandas
- sqlite3
- all the needed langchain packages

## Usage
1. Start the process by running the start.bat file or by running in order the following files:
- ai.py
- server.py
- app.py (streamlit run app.py)
2. Once the server is running, you can add queries in the streamlit app and get the answers from the server. You can do this uploding a file or writing the query in the text box.
3. The server will pass the query to the AI, which will return the answer. The server will then update the database.
4. The user can see the answer in the streamlit app, in the database section.

## Notes
- The AI will run on localhost:5000
- The server will run on localhost:8000
- The streamlit app will run on localhost:8501

You can change the ports in the code if you want to.

By default the number of queries that the server will send to the AI is 3. You can change this number in the congfig.yaml file.

This project is a work in progress, so there are still some bugs and improvements to be made. Feel free to contribute to the project by opening an issue or a pull request.
